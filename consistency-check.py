Dump all the docs/rows in Elasticsearch/Postgres and diff their respective
(external_id, txid, version) tuples. Ideally they're the same.

This is not expected to be necessary in a production setting, but is useful
to sanity check what the syncing process has done, especially after subjecting
it to the load generator for a while.
